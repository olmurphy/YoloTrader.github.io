## Bug Description

#### Issues
- `create account` creates a profile, adds it into the list of 
profiles, but when exiting application, it does not save it into
the xml file,
- `add watchlist` adds a watchlist to the profile's list of
stockwatchlists but it does not save it into the xml

To sum, no new info is saving into the xml file anymore... It loads
and saves all the previous information fine.
