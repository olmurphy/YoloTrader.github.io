YoloTrader was inspired by the ability to day trade stocks and make a lot of money.
However, how do we keep track of the stocks that we are wanting to invest in? Well,
YoloTrader solves that problem. It allows for its users to search up a stock they
want to view, given a ticker and returns that stock. The user can add to a watchlist
of stocks and in addition have the application analyze that stock letting the user
know if it is a good idea to invest.
