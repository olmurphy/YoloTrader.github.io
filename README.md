# Software Project I 

## Yolo Trader
YoloTrader is a day trading stock analysis application
that allows users the following functionality:
- create a stock watch list (i.e. a StockWatchList)
- add stock to a watch list
- comment on a stock watch list
- delete stock watch list

from this, the basic idea is the user is able to keep a list of
stocks they are interested in and track them.

Some possible functionalities that we could incorporate are:
- 'univerisal comments', where a comment from one user on a particular
stock would be viewable from other users
- look up other users

### IMPORTANT:
- [DataBaseUtil](YoloTrader/Prototype/src/main/java/edu/baylor/ecs/csi3471/model/DataBaseUtil.java) 
is only an experimental class and will be deleted once database configurations for the xml
binding are complete.
- [database.xml](YoloTrader/Prototype/database.xml) has experimental values. **Need** to figure
how to make the "comments" be properly indented
